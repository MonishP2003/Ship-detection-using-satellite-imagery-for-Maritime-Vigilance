# Ship-detection-using-satellite-imagery-for-Maritime-Vigilance
This project aims to detect ships in satellite images using advanced image processing techniques and neural networks.

<br/> 

## Introduction:

The Ship Detection Project utilizes various machine learning techniques to identify ships in satellite images. The project leverages OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow/Keras for building and training neural networks.

<br/>

## Features:

Data Visualization: Analyzes ship sizes and color distribution in images.

Image Processing: Processes images using OpenCV, including color space conversion and orientation distribution analysis.

Model Development: Implements a neural network with custom loss functions and metrics.

Training Optimization: Enhances model training using callbacks like ReduceLROnPlateau and EarlyStopping.

Model Evaluation: Provides functions for model predictions and visualizes results.

Deployment: Saves and loads trained models for further predictions.

<br/>

## Results:

Results include visualizations of ship size distribution, color histograms, and predictions made by the trained model.
